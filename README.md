# Time-series-and-NPL-project


This project aims to investigate the evolution of public sentiment towards the vaccine on social media by analyzing a large dataset of tweets collected on Kaggle. VADER sentiment analysis will be used to obtain sentiment scores, and time series analysis will be employed to analyze how public sentiment has changed over time in response to various events and news related to the vaccine. The results of this study can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence public sentiment towards the vaccine and inform decision-making for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and pharmaceutical companies. ![image](https://github.com/q-vietle/Time-series-and-NPL-project/assets/147361189/b3bb2d54-0c41-4c10-b488-000d10e8c2cb)
